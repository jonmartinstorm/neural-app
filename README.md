This code defines a `NeuralNetwork` structure that has weights for three layers (two hidden layers and one output layer). The `forward_pass` method computes the output of the neural network for a given input, while the `train` method updates the weights using backpropagation.

The `train_iterations` method trains the neural network on randomly generated input for a specified number of iterations. In the `main` function, we create a new neural network, train it for 10,000 iterations, and test its output for an example input.

Please note that this is a simple example for illustrative purposes and may not provide the most efficient or accurate results. You can further optimize and expand this code as needed for your specific use case.
